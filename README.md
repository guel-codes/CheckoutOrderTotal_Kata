# CheckoutOrderTotal_Kata
 Checkout Order Kata to test TDD

This Kata exercise was to build an Item checkout application for a store. The test_cases were as follows:
 1) Instantiate a checkout Class
 2) Add item price
 3) Add Item
 4) Calculate current total
 5) Can add multiple items and get correct total
 6) Can add discount rules and apply the rules to the total
 
 I followed the "Unit Testing and Test Driven Development in Python" course on Lynda to get a feel for TDD.
